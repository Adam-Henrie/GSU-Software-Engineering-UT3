Android App Source code under master branch. 

This project finished. Baseline functionality of the DoorDash like app has been completed. This was my first foray into Android App design. Learned from scratch over a semester period. Code is currently in the master branch not the main branch. 




Old Bugs:
The login activity has started to act oddly. Currently if you are doing your first install of the app on the emulator in android studio MAKE SURE TO LOGIN and make an account on the first run. 
There is is bug in the code, if you log in then log out and close the app before recompiling the code because you changed it, the app crashes. 
Make sure to stay logged in while using the app in the emulator and every launch after that point will still incorporate any new changes to the code.
